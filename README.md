# PCem - My Version  
## Actually patched up v17  
  
I find this software to be amazing for testing operating systems developed for old hardware.  
However, if you will download it from the official webpage and try to run it, you will see an error message will come up and say "No ROMs present!". I was able to fix this by following [a video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dOD1wwtfrjY). To spare others of going through the trouble of copy-pasting stuff, I have uploaded the whole PCem deal I am using. Just download this repo and you would be good to go.  
On a side-note, I appreciate the work done by team PCem and 86box. I am just a tinkerer who just shamelessly copied a few things and uploaded it to GitHub so that others like me can use it. So, don't drag me into any debates, etc.
